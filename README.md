<h1>  About Ph-Scale: </h1> <br>
 The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that an increase or decrease of an integer value changes the concentration by a tenfold.
 <br>
In chemistry, pH, also referred to as acidity or basicity, historically denotes "potential of hydrogen". It is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. Acidic solutions are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions.
