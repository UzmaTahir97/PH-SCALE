<h1>About Ph Scale:</h1>
<br>
pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 - 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base.

In chemistry, pH, also referred to as acidity or basicity, historically denotes "potential of hydrogen". It is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. Acidic solutions are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions.
